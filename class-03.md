##### Definition lists are expressed as dl, followed by dt which is the term beind defined, and dd which is the definition of the term.

##### Nested lists are basically pressing tab to nest list items under other list items. You can do this by using ol or ul then pressing tab.

### Boxes 

##### dimensions are expressed in width and height and you can change the limits by min-width, max-width min-height, and max-height.

##### Overflowing content can have hidden or scroll values. hidden hides content that doesn't fit in the box, scroll adds a scroll bar so the user can see the rest of the content.

##### Borders are found on every box and is expressed as 0 pixels wide. Margins are the outside edge of a border. You can set the width to whatever you want. The padding is the space between the border and content. Adding padding can increase the readability of text or content.

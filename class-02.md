### Markup

##### Structural markup are elements that can describe <heading> and <p>

##### Semantic markup gives extra info, like emphasis in a sentence, or a quotation.

##### Headings go from h1 to h6, with no levels below h6. 

##### Paragraphs can be infiinte, but you can't label them by number. They will always be expressed as <p></p>

##### You can bold and italicize words by using <b></b> and <i></i>.

##### You can make subscripts, like exponents on numbers, with <sup>, and other numbers like that in the chemical makeup of water (H20) with <sub>
  
##### White space in line doesn't matter, the browser collapses them. That way code doesn't mess with what the user sees.

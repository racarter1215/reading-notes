### Markup

##### Structural markup are elements that can describe <heading> and <p>

##### Semantic markup gives extra info, like emphasis in a sentence, or a quotation.

##### Headings go from h1 to h6, with no levels below h6. 

##### Paragraphs can be infiinte, but you can't label them by number. They will always be expressed as <p></p>

##### You can bold and italicize words by using <b></b> and <i></i>.

##### You can make subscripts, like exponents on numbers, with <sup>, and other numbers like that in the chemical makeup of water (H20) with <sub>
  
##### White space in line doesn't matter, the browser collapses them. That way code doesn't mess with what the user sees.

##### Line breaks are written like <br />, and serve as an "enter" key in code (at least as it shows to the browser user)

##### Horizontal rules can be added with <hr />. This allows you to make whatever you want within a section (see p.48 for an example)

##### Strong emphasis is written as <strong>. Less strong emphasis is written as <em>
  
##### Quotations can be written either as <blockquote> or <q>, depending on how much of a section of writing you want quoted.
  
##### You can abbreviate by writing <abbr> after the abbreviation is used
  
##### One can cite by writing <cite></cite> for whatever work you are using, it will render as italicized.

##### For authors, you can put their informaiton in <address>, so it's contained in one area.
  
##### You can "line out" text in paragraphs using the <del>, and underline something with <ins>
  
### CSS Structure

##### Imagine it as an "invisible box" around each element in an HTML, and that you can manipulate it as such

##### We use selectors (p, h1, header, etc.) and declarations (font-family:, background-color:, color:, etc.)

##### Curly brackets are used to contain CSS code both in HTML and in CSS documents.

##### External CSS are documents attached to HTML via a link found in the head.

##### Internal CSS are within the HTML documenet itself and are either found in style, which affects the whole document, or inline, which affects the specific portion it is within.

##### List of CSS selectors on p. 238

##### Order of precedence is termed as "cascading". If you write a rule that affects p, for example, after another rule that affects p, it overrules it.

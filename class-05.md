# Images

### Storing Images

##### You can store in folder labeled images, with subfolders like interface, products, and news. The point is is to ensure that different types of images are separated so that you can reference them easier.

##### add igames with img (image), src (tells browser where it can find image file), alt (provides a text description of image if one can't see it), and title (provides additional info about image). A completed code strant is img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of quokka" title="The quokka is an Australian marsupial that is similar in size to the domestic cat." /

##### you can change height and width of image. Example = img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of quokka" width="600" height="450" /

##### place images before, inside the start of, or in the middle of paragraphs

##### you can align images orizontally. Example align="left" /

##### you can align images vertically. Example align="top" /

##### Three rules for creating images

###### save images in right size
###### measure images in pixels

### image formats

##### jpeg

### Color

##### foreground color comes in either rgb values, hex codes, or color names

##### background-color also comes in these values. Example: body{ background-color: rgb(200,200,200);}

##### rgb is expressed in 3 values between 0 and 255

##### hex is a code, such as #66cdaa

##### color names are just stating something like black or white

##### contrasts can be low, medium, or high. basically match the text and background color to ensure good contrast

##### opacity is expressed by rgba (a number between 0.0 and 1.0). think of 0.5 being 50% opacity.

##### HSL colors include hue, saturation and lightness

##### hue is picking a color in a color circle, expressed as 0 to 360 (angles of circle)

##### saturation is a percentage between 0 and 100

##### lightness is from 0% (pitch black) to 100% (white)

##### hsl and hsla (stands for hue, saturation, lightness)(and in the case of hsla, alpha)

##### hsl example: background-color: hsl(0,0%,78%);

##### hsla example: background-color: hsla(0,100%,100%,0.5);

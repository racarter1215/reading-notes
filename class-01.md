# Reading Assignment 1: 3-2-2020

### Book Structure

##### HTML
######  HTML is discussed in first part with tags and structure being described

##### CSS
###### The book discusses how CSS controls both the presentation and layout of web pages. CSS can be added onto HTML directly or by linking CSS code to HTML in the head

##### Practical
###### The book describes new HTML5 code and walkthroughs on site creation and CSS integration.

### Websites

##### Browsers include Chrome and Firefox and are how people access a website

##### Browser requests are sent to computers called web servers

##### Screen readers are programs that "read out the contents of a computer screen to a user."

### Web pages are like newspaper pages

##### They also follow the logic of Word documents regarding headings

### HTML describes page structure and reads like a newspaper

##### Tags such as body, head, and p are used to delineate different sections of the page. Adding code to each specific section is called "nesting"

##### Tags are created by putting <> or </> around the part of the HTML you are creating.

### Attributes

##### Made up of a NAME and a VALUE. Example: <p lang="en-us">Paragraph in English</p>

### Markup

##### HTML4 is generally what we use now, and what is taught in the book

##### XHTML 1.0 was created in 2000 and updated HTML4

##### HTML5 is currently being worked on, and is periodically taught within the book

### Sections of HTML: Doctype, comments (expressed as <!-- -->), ID attributes, Class attributes, block and inline elements, grouping texts, and iframes.

### Escape characters are used for special symbols such as cypyright and trademark. Examples are seen on page 194.

### HTML5

##### No longer uses elements like div

##### Headers contain the site name and footers contain copywright information

##### Nav contains navigation blocks. They don't count as major blocks unless you put them under their own nav element

##### Articles are inside their own article elements. They can also be nested inside each other.

##### Asides inside articles have additional info, outside articles they contain info for the entire page.

##### Sections groups related items together and can split up articles for ease of reading.

##### Heading groups can group together h1 - h6 headings into a single heading.

##### Figures should be used when content refrences the element, not something important.

##### While div is largely replaced, it can be used if no suitable element works for a particular part of the page.

### Who to create a website for?

#####  One must know the target audience when creating a webpage, particularly regarding its information structure.

##### Understand why people visit your site and what they are trying to achieve.

###### Also consier what info visitors need and the frequency they visit your site.

##### This all feeds into information prioritization, with the most important information found first.

##### You can accomplish this through site maps, which can be planned out by utilizing wireframes.

### Wireframes

##### These are sketches of important info that will be on a site, and where it is going to be placed.

##### Helps developers understand where in the HTML info goes.

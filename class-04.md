# Links

### Writing Links

##### Links are created using the <a> tag. you specify the page you want to link with the href attribute.

##### Example: <a href="http://www.imdb.com:>IMDB</a>

##### Linking to other sites requires the absolute url (the whole thing from "http" to ".whatever")

##### Linking to other pages on the site requires the relative url, such as "contact.html"

##### Directory structure:
  ###### top is root folter, then go down like a family tree (via relationships to root). 

##### Email links are made by using mailto, example: a href="mailto:jon@example.org" Email Jon /a

### Layout

##### Key concepts include blocks within boxes (block-level or inline). If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is know as the containing or parent element.

##### Element positions are controlled by positioning schemes (normal flow, relative positionings, absolute positionings, fixed positionings, and floating elements)

##### These are expressed as position:static, position:relative, position:absolute, position:fixed, z-index, and float 

### Functions, Methods, and Objects

##### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. When you ask it to perform a task, its called "calling" a funciton

##### Pieces of info passed to a function are known as parameters. When you write a function and you expect it to provide you with an answer, the response is known as a return value.

### Declaring a function

##### function sayHello() {
        document.write('Hello!');
      }

##### sayHello(); is the function name

### 6 reasons to pair programming

##### pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.

### Why pair programming?

##### Greater Efficiency
##### Engaged collaboration
##### Learning from fellow students
##### Social skills
##### Job interview readiness
##### Work environment readiness

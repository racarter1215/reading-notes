# Layout

### Positioning Elements

##### CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. Box witll be either a block-level or inline box.

##### block-level elements (h1, p, ul, li)

##### inline elements (img, b, i)

##### if one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

###### It is common to group a number of elements together inside a div (or other block-level) element.

##### CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS> You can also float elements using the float property

##### Normal flow (position:static)

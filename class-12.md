# Basic Usage

### The canvas element

##### <canvas id="tutorial" width="150" height="150"></canvas>

##### similar to image code but doesn't have src or alt attributes. without width or height defined, it is set at 300px width and 150px high.

##### The <canvas> element differs from an <img> tag in that, like for <video>, <audio>, or <picture> elements, it is easy to define some fallback content, to be displayed in older browsers not supporting it, like versions of Internet Explorer earlier than version 9 or textual browsers. You should always provide fallback content to be displayed by those browsers.
  
##### Canvas REQUIRES a closing /canvas tag. Also, if the browser doesn't read canvas, you can always add image/alt information within the code
